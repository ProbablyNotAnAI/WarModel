# WarModel
Script for extracting mesh data from .spk files for wargame red dragon. written in node js.

note, when importing .obj files in to blender they are verry large and the viewport draw distance will need to be adjusted.

this is currently working on modelesshowroom.spk, modelesvilles.spk and modelesindustries.spk, mesh_all.spk has some format changes (it may be compresses) and is not compatable

there are currently some issues when exporting UVS
