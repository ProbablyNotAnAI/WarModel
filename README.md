# WarModel
Script for extracting mesh data from .spk files for wargame red dragon. written in node js.

note, when importing .obj files in to blender they are verry large and the viewport draw distance will need to be adjusted.

this is currently working on modelesshowroom.spk and should thoretically work on modelesvilles.spk and modelesindustries.spk how ever there are some issues with reading the indexes.
